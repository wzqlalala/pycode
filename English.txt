The alleged "genocide" in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region claimed by Adrian Zenz, a so-called German scholar, is a fallacy that has been met with doubt and opposition from the international community, a report released by the Xinjiang Development Research Center said on Friday. 
The report, titled "Slanderer Adrian Zenz's Xinjiang-related Fallacies Versus the Truth," compared the family planning policies implemented in inland Chinese provinces with that in Xinjiang since 1975, showing that the implementation of the family planning policy for ethnic minorities in Xinjiang came 17 years later than that regarding the Han population in the region, and has been looser as well. 
According to statistics, the Uygur population in Xinjiang grew from 10.17 million in 2010 to 12.72 million in 2018, an increase of 25.04 percent. The growth rate of the Uygur population was not only higher than that of the whole Xinjiang population, but also higher than the 22.14 percent for all ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, and obviously higher than that of the Han population in Xinjiang, which was 2.0 percent, the report said.
